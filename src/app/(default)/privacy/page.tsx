        <h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
        <p>
          Like most website operators, Bungalow Finder collects non-personal
          information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
          available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
          site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Bungalow Finder
          &apos;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information
          is to better understand how Bungalow Finder&apos;s visitors use its
          website. From time to time, Bungalow Finder may release non-personal
          information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends
          in the usage of its website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bungalow Finder also collects potentially personal information like
          Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Bungalow Finder
          only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the
          same circumstances that it uses and discloses personal information as
          described below, except that user generated content (“UGC”) IP
          addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the UGC
          where the comment was left.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bungalow Finder may collect statistics about the behaviour of visitors
          to its websites. For instance, Bungalow Finder may monitor the most

          display this information publicly or provide it to others. However,
          Bungalow Finder does not disclose personal information other than as
          described below.

          visitor&apos;s interaction with Bungalow Finder. And visitors can
          always refuse to supply personal information, with the caveat that it
          may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities
