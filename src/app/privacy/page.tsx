        <h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
        <p>
          Like most website operators, Preserve Oakville collects non-personal
          information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
          available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
          site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Preserve Oakville
          &apos;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information
          is to better understand how Preserve Oakville&apos;s visitors use its
          website. From time to time, Preserve Oakville may release non-personal
          information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends
          in the usage of its website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Preserve Oakville also collects potentially personal information like
          Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Preserve
          Oakville only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses
          under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personal
          information as described below, except that user generated content
          (“UGC”) IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators
          of the UGC where the comment was left.
        </p>
        <p>
          Preserve Oakville may collect statistics about the behaviour of
          visitors to its websites. For instance, Preserve Oakville may monitor
          the most popular solutions built on Preserve Oakville . Preserve
          Oakville may display this information publicly or provide it to
          others. However, Preserve Oakville does not disclose personal
          information other than as described below.
        </p>
        <p>
          A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor
          &apos;s computer, and that the visitor&apos;s browser provides to the
          website each time the visitor returns. Preserve Oakville uses cookies
          to help Preserve Oakville identify and track visitors, their usage of
          Preserve Oakville website, and their website access preferences.
          Preserve Oakville visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on
          their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before
          using.
        </p>
        <p>
          Preserve Oakville&apos;s websites, with the drawback that certain
          features of Preserve Oakville&apos;s websites may not function
          properly without the aid of cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certain visitors to Preserve Oakville&apos;s websites choose to
          interact with Preserve Oakville in ways that require Preserve Oakville
          to gather personal information. The amount and type of information
          that Bungalow Finder gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
          For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account or newsletter
          at www.bungalowfinder.ca to provide an email address and as well are
          asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the
          personal information required to share the relevant information with
          them. In each case, Preserve Oakville collects such information only
          insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the
          visitor&apos;s interaction with Preserve Oakville. And visitors can
          always refuse to supply personal information, with the caveat that it
          may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities
        </p>
        <h2>How Do We Use the Personal Information We Collect?</h2>
        <p>

          marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze Site usage, to improve

          expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a
          request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback
          mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
          clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.

          against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of

          process it on Preserve Oakville&apos;s behalf or to provide services
          available at Preserve Oakville&apos;s websites, and (ii) that have
          agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,

          organizations, as described above, Preserve Oakville discloses

          Finder believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary
          to protect the property or rights of Preserve Oakville, third parties
          or the public at large.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Also</b>, if Preserve Oakville, or substantially all of its assets
          were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Preserve Oakville goes
          out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of
          the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You
          acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of
          Preserve Oakville may continue to use your personal information as set
          forth in this policy.
