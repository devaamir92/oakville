<h3>History of Uptown Core</h3>
<p>
  Uptown Core has a rich history, originating from Trafalgar Township, which
  merged with Oakville and Bronte Village in 1962 to form the Town of Oakville.
  Before amalgamation, Trafalgar Township was an agricultural community. The
  pioneering families like the Jones, Munn, Hays, Sullivan, and Fleming, settled
  in the Uptown Core. Their legacy is honoured with an interpretive heritage
  memorial plaque in Memorial Park commemorating their contributions to the
  area.
